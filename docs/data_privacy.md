## Data retention policy
We store the apartments you save. That's it. Any apartment that get searched gets "cached," so it's quicker for the next person to search, but that's not attached to your user name. The only information we keep is the apartments you've saved, using your email as the identifier.

This data is used to populate the comparison page. We don't intend to analyze it for anything. It will remain stored in our database server until we delete it according to our (forthcoming) data deletion policy. As we are in beta right now, we have not implemented any data deletion. We hope to implement this, and data updates, soon.

Otherwise, your email is your account. We allow Google to handle authentication with Gmail if you so choose. That email is stored in our application's database. Our email provider, Brevo, may store some data according to their [privacy policy](https://www.brevo.com/legal/privacypolicy/).

We will notify all exposed users if there is a data breach. We follow standard logging and security practices to reduce the chance of a data breach and to allow us to monitor if one occurs. Our main approach to managing risk is to reduce the information we collect. We only collect what we need for certain functionality to work. This approach aims to keep risk to our users as low as it can be.
