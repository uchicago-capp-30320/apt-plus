This directory contains key documentation on Apartments Plus.

Apartments Plus aggregates broad data with a focus on those that mainstream rental sites do not display, such as building defects and landlord reputations. Apartments Plus is currently focused on tenants in a university neighborhood like Hyde Park which welcomes a steady influx of new tenants every year but neighborhood-specific information such as university transportation routes that are not available on major rental sites.

Apartments Plus is and will remain an open source project. Feel free to explore our design, and if this type of work inspires you, weâ€™d love to have your help.
