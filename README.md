# Apartments Plus
Tenants struggle to navigate scattered information when searching for a new apartment. Without a centralized solution to aggregate key information, renters must take significant time to research or risk unforeseen downsides. This is exacerbated by popular commercial platforms' incentive to hide negative aspects of their listings. As generalist platforms, they also lack granularity in neighborhood details, for example, a distance to grocery stores known to local residents.

Apartments Plus aggregates broad data with a focus on those that mainstream rental sites do not display, such as building defects and landlord reputations. Apartments Plus is currently focused on tenants in a university neighborhood like Hyde Park which welcomes a steady influx of new tenants every year but neighborhood-specific information such as university transportation routes that are not available on major rental sites.
