        <p class="is-size-6 ">
          Apartments Plus aggregates data about apartment rentals. We focus on information that mainstream
          rental sites do not display. While mainstream platforms offer polished listings and curated
          photographs, they often omit the kinds of information that matter most: an 17-minute walk to the bus
          stop that's just impossible in the rain, the unresolved complaints, the landlord who locals know not
          to rent from. We set out to fill in those blind spots. Apartments Plus currently supports tenants in
          university neighborhoods like Hyde Park, Chicago as these neighborhoods welcome a steady stream of new
          tenants every year.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-6 ">
          Apartments Plus is built on transparency. Not just transparency about the features of the
          apartments you can rent, but transparency in process. We take publicly accessible data, aggregate
          it, and then put it in a format that you can easily understand. We've all been burned by apartments,
          especially in places where you will only live for a couple years and your landlord knows it. Because of this
          motivation, our product will remain open source and we will communicate not just how we do things, but why as
          well.

          We welcome public collaboration and contribution for this project. We started local, focusing on
          Hyde Park, where we live and study. Searching for apartments is not just a local problem. If you
          feel that providing clear and open information on apartments in your neighborhood is something you
          care about, please check out this project on <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/apt-plus"
            target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

          that on our GitHub!
